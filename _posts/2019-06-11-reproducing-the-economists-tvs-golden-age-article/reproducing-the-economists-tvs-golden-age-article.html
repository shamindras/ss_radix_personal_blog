<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Being a huge TV buff growing up it is great to be living in what is heralded as the “Golden Age of Television” <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I recently came across this fantastic article in <em>The Economist</em> <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on the same topic which had some beautiful looking illustrative interactive charts.</p>
<p>Naturally as a statistics graduate student I wanted to reproduce the graphics just as a good analysis and <code>R</code> coding practice. I thought to document the process here in case anyone else wanted to follow along.</p>
<h1 id="data-and-approach">Data and Approach</h1>
<p>Here <em>The Economist</em> authors very kindly provide all of the data and code for this article and others in an public <code>Github</code> repository<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We will not look at the code for this article (since we are going to build it from scratch ourselves), but only download the required data files.</p>

Honesty system applies here 😄

<p>So we have a nice interactive table layout ready for us to play with. We have dropped the <code>tt_id</code> i.e. the unique title ID for each show to make the table cleaner to display. It also looks like the raw title is used in the charts and so this field is likely not needed. Our <code>tibble</code> has 2,266 rows and 7 fields so a very manageable dataset provided here for us to work with ✌️.</p>
