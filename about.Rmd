Hi there! I’m Shamindra Shrotriya, a graduate student in Statistics at the
wonderful Carnegie Mellon University (Go Tartans!). I’ve decided to start 
blogging to document my learning and development in statistics as a new 
graduate student.

I’d like it to be a fun place to document interesting things I like to 
read about in the statistics and machine learning space (`rstats`, `python`, 
`theory`…) as well as anything else I am into e.g. books, cricket 
(the Indian/ Australian version of baseball) etc.

Feel free to pull up a chair and join me so that we can explore together.
